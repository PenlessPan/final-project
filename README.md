# final-project

The following are instructions for replicating our analysis of the project:

  1) Make a new directory in the directory where the 'project code.rmd' file is located and name it "data".
  2) Insert 'child_risk_t12.sav' and '3rd assessment.sav' files into the new "data" directory.
  3) Before you run the code make sure that the directory where the 'project code.rmd' file is located is set as the working directory.
  4) After you press run there may be a window pop-up which will ask you to select a CRAN mirror, at that time scroll down to the bottom and select "USA (IA) [https]".
