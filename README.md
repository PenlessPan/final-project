# final-project

The following are instructions for replicating our analysis of the project:

  1) Make a new directory in the directory where the 'project code.rmd' file is located and name it "data".
  2) Insert 'child_risk_t12.sav' and '3rd assessment.sav' files into the new "data" directory.
  3) Before you run the code make sure that the directory where the 'project code.rmd' file is located is set as the working directory.

     If there are any difficulties in setting the directory as the working directory follow the next steps:
     1) Obtain the path to the 'child_risk_t12.sav' file and replace "./data/child_risk_t12.sav" at line 19 in the code with the path.
     2) Obtain the path to the '3rd assessment.sav' file and replace "./data/3rd assessment.sav" at line 20 in the code with the path.
     
  4) After you press run there may be a window pop-up which will ask you to select a CRAN mirror, at that time scroll down to the bottom and select "USA (IA) [https]".
